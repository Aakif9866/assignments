    "# Buffering in file handling refers to the temporary storage of data in a buffer while it's being transferred between the program and the file. This mechanism improves the efficiency of read and write operations by reducing the number of system calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Buffering:\n",
    "# Full Buffering: Data is stored in the buffer until it is full. This mode is typically used for files.\n",
    "# Line Buffering: Data is stored in the buffer until a newline character is encountered. This mode is usually used for text files.\n",

    "# How Buffering Helps:\n",
    "# Reduces I/O Operations: By minimizing the number of read and write operations to the disk, buffering reduces the overhead and increases performance.\n",
    "# Improves Speed: Buffering allows for more efficient use of resources, improving the speed of file operations.\n",
